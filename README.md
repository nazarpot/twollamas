## What are the expand files?
Take input:
* p = Pick Up
* d = Drop Off
* w = Weight
* r = Rate
* t = Temperature
* o = "on" the date

expand takes such params (any number) and converts to a more readable
format. It also automatically adds to clipboard, so you can past it 
wherever needed.

### Format converted into(ex):
input: p1200 d1200 w30k r4 t32 o1023

output:
Pick up: 12:00
Drop off: 12:00
Weight: 30k lbs
Rate: $4 per mile
Temperature: 32Â°
